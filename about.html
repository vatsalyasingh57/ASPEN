    <p>This virtual assistant has been created under the community service project.</p>
    <h4> Working of Virtual Assistant</h4>
    <ol>
      <li> Voice Input or User Interface: - <br>
        This web page has a user interface that allows users to interact with the voice assistant. This includes the microphone button, suggestions on what questions one can ask, the introduction of the voice assistants, and the logo that suggests it is listening to the commands of the user. This user interface provides visual clues such as the greeting message that the virtual assistant speaks, the changing color of the microphone button, and the pulsation of the microphone button when it is hovered upon.
      </li>
      <br><li>
        Speech Recognition: -<br>
It is the most important crucial component of the virtual assistant. It converts the spoken words into text that can be understood and processed by the system. There are various conditions, APIs, and libraries that are used to convert speech to text.
     </li>
     <br> <li>
    
      Natural Language Processing (NLP): - <br>
After the speech is recognized, the text is processed to understand the user’s intent and extracts the relevant information. Many techniques like natural language understanding are employed to analyze the text and extract meaningful data. Tools like conditioning and NLP libraries are implemented to make the NLP easy.
     </li>
     <br><li>
    Intent Recognition: - <br>
The next process is to identify the requirements of the user by making use of major keywords in the text that is processed in the previous stage. Many APIs calls are made in order to generate a perfect response for the command the user gave. Here machine learning models were implemented as those models are trained on data sets to learn patterns and associations between the user input and corresponding intent.
     </li>
     <br><li>
      Backend Processing: - <br>
Once the user intents are clarified and recognized the system performs the necessary actions or retrieves information to provide a response accordingly. This involves the use of APIs to retrieve specific data on various topics and also it relies on redirection to pages to provide a detailed answer to the question asked. The databases are also used to store user queries and the commands the user used previously so as to provide a quick response.

     </li>
     <br><li>
     Response Generation: - <br>
After the user request is processed ASPEN generates a response. The response depends on the request sometime it just gives out a voice output, for some requests the user is redirected to the specified website according to the user’s need, and sometimes it just gives the response in plain simple text. The use of TEXT-TO-SPEECH API is implemented to give out a reply to the request by the voice assistant.
